4. Upload Dataset into the created cluster and connect it in Github CodeSpaces
5. Make sure remote connect is working and Databricks remote connection works
## Dataset:
- The dataset that I have downloaded is BikeSharing dataset (Link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shrutipandit707/bikesharing), named as `day_2.csv` on Databricks
-  This dataset provides the information about the bike rent status based on date, weather, etc features
